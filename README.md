<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the study of statistical and computational principles and techniques that enable machines to improve their performance on a specific task through experience or training.</p>

In machine learning, the learning process typically involves the following steps:

<ul>
<li><b>Data collection:</b> Gathering relevant data that represents the problem domain and includes features or attributes that are informative for the task at hand. The quality and quantity of the data play a crucial role in the success of machine learning algorithms.</li>

<li><b>Data preprocessing:</b> Cleaning and transforming the raw data to ensure its quality, remove noise or outliers, handle missing values, and normalize or scale the features. This step prepares the data for further analysis.</li>

<li><b>Feature extraction/selection:</b> Identifying and selecting the most relevant features from the dataset that will contribute to the learning process. Feature extraction involves transforming the raw data into a more meaningful representation, while feature selection focuses on identifying the most informative subset of features.</li>

<li><b>Model selection:</b> Choosing an appropriate machine learning model or algorithm that is well-suited for the problem at hand. The choice of the model depends on the nature of the data, the type of task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), and other factors such as interpretability, scalability, and available computational resources.</li>

<li><b>Model training:</b> Using the prepared data to train the selected model. During the training process, the model learns patterns or relationships in the data and adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the error or maximize a performance metric, such as accuracy or loss function.</li>

<li><b>Model evaluation:</b> Assessing the performance of the trained model on a separate set of data called the test set or validation set. Various evaluation metrics are used to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data and to compare different models or hyperparameter configurations.</li>

<li><b>Model deployment:</b> Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed and used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The model should be able to handle real-time or batch predictions depending on the application requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Machine learning encompasses a wide range of techniques and algorithms, including but not limited to linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning. It finds applications in various domains such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, healthcare, finance, and many others.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that machine learning is an iterative process that involves refining and improving the models based on feedback and new data. It requires a combination of domain knowledge, data expertise, mathematical/statistical understanding, and programming skills to effectively apply and leverage machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems.</p>

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Linear regression is a statistical modeling technique used to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a fundamental method in statistics and machine learning for predictive analysis and understanding the relationship between variables.</p>

<p>In linear regression, the goal is to fit a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to a given set of data points. The line is defined by a mathematical equation of the form:

y = mx + b

Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>y represents the dependent variable or the variable we are trying to predict.</li>
<li>x represents one or more independent variables or predictors.</li>
<li>m represents the slope of the line, which determines the direction and steepness.</li>
<li>b represents the y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is equal to 0.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Residual Sum of Squares</h3>
<p>RSS stands for Residual Sum of Squares. In the context of linear regression, it refers to the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the corresponding predicted values obtained from the linear regression model.

Mathematically, the RSS can be calculated as follows:

RSS = Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²

Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>yᵢ represents the observed value of the dependent variable for each data point.</li>
<li>ȳ represents the mean of the observed values of the dependent variable.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Best Fit Line</h3>
<p>The best fit line, also known as the regression line, is the straight line that represents the most optimal or best-fitting linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables in a linear regression model. The term "best fit" indicates that this line minimizes the overall error or discrepancy between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear regression model.</p>

<p>In a simple linear regression (with one independent variable), the best fit line is represented by the equation:

y = mx + b

Where:</p>

<ul>

<li>y is the dependent variable (the variable we are trying to predict).</li>
<li>x is the independent variable (the predictor variable).</li>
<li>m is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change of y concerning x.</li>
<li>b is the y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is equal to 0.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Hyperparameter</h2>
<p>A hyperparameter is a configuration setting used to control the training process of a machine learning model. Unlike the parameters of a model, which are learned from training data, hyperparameters are set prior to the training process and are not learned from the data. They essentially define the behavior and characteristics of the machine learning algorithm itself.</p>

<h2>Ridge Regression</h2>
<p>Ridge regression, also known as L2 regularization, is a linear regression technique used in statistics and machine learning to address the issue of multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) and to prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a regularization term to the linear regression cost function.</p>
